Item Class and lemon Class can be interchangable so they apply to Liskkov's substitution principle.
on line 10 in Item and Line 9 in lemon we pointed out the L in SOLID.

In the pitcher Class we have pointed out on Line 10 that It pertains to the Single responsibility Principle.
It is the S in SOLID and it only tells how many cups per pitcher.
